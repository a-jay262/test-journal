Each year adds new dimensions to your character and new depth to your understanding of yourself and the world.\n\nThis year, may you have the courage to be vulnerable when strength would be easier.

These choices shape not just your year but your character, and your character is your legacy. The person you're becoming is someone worth celebrating today and always.",
    
    "May your birthday be as multi-dimensional and wonderful as you are!

May you understand that some of life's most valuable lessons come wrapped in experiences we might not have chosen but that choose us for reasons we may not immediately understand. Trust the process.",
    
    "Happy Birthday! Today we celebrate not just your birth but the incredible person you've become and the even more amazing person you're becoming. This moment is a beautiful intersection of your past, present, and future—all converging in the now.\n\nAs you stand at this threshold, may you carry forward the wisdom of your experiences while releasing what no longer serves you.
